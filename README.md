# How I manage state in react web application.

Managing state in React is quite tricky. But if you get the concept it is more fun then it sounds. In React there is more than one way and techniques to handle state. One of the most common way is using the **useState** hook, this way I manage state in my web apps projects. This method allows functional components to declare and manage state variables. These variables can store data that to change the behavior and user interface of the component. Declaring **useState** with an initial value, I create a state variable that can be updated using a similar setter function. This allows the component to re-render the state.
